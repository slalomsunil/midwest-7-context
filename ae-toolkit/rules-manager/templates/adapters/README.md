# Adapter Templates

These templates provide instructions for adapting the modular rules system to work with specific AI development tools.

## Available Adapters

- `CLAUDE_ADAPTATION.template.md` - Instructions for Claude Projects and artifacts
- `COPILOT_ADAPTATION.template.md` - Instructions for GitHub Copilot configuration
- `CURSOR_ADAPTATION.template.md` - Instructions for Cursor IDE rules setup

## How Adapters Work

Each adapter template provides:

1. **Tool-specific file structure** - Where to place files for each AI tool
2. **Configuration patterns** - How to structure rules for optimal tool integration
3. **Feature utilization** - How to leverage each tool's unique capabilities
4. **Integration instructions** - Step-by-step setup process

## Usage Process

1. **Choose your target AI tool(s)** based on your team's preferences
2. **Follow the specific adapter template** for implementation guidance
3. **Generate tool configurations** that reference your modular rules
4. **Test the integration** to ensure rules work as expected

## Multi-Tool Support

You can implement multiple adapters simultaneously to support teams using different AI tools while maintaining consistent rule behavior across all tools.
