# Glossary

This is not meant to be exhaustive. Only for defining terms that _may_ be unique within Slalom.

**AIAE** - Acronym standing for **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence **A**ccelerated **E**ngineering

**Context Engineering** - The systematic discipline of creating precise, comprehensive guidance that enables AI development tools to understand and work effectively within specific project environments. This involves analyzing project architecture, patterns, and constraints; documenting team standards and development practices; creating clear, actionable guidance for AI tools; and establishing processes for maintaining and evolving AI development support. As a context engineer, you transform implicit team knowledge into explicit, actionable documentation that helps AI tools generate code that feels native to the project.

**Context** - File-based documentation that is linked into AI tools via the tool's specific configuration file (e.g., CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, .github/copilot-instructions.md) that helps the tool discover relevant information quickly and reliably without overwhelming the chat session's context window. Project context includes architectural decisions, coding patterns, development workflows, team standards, and project-specific guidance that enables AI tools to generate code that feels native to the project environment.

**Context Organization Methodology** - A structured, systematic approach to managing and organizing project information specifically for AI consumption. This encompasses how documentation is assembled, formatted, sequenced, and delivered to AI systems to enable effective code generation and decision-making. Context organization methodologies range from simple templated approaches to robust enterprise-grade frameworks, with the optimal approach being project-specific based on complexity, scale, and requirements.

**Development Methodology** - Traditional software development process frameworks such as Agile, Scrum, Kanban, or DevOps that define how teams organize work, manage projects, plan sprints, handle releases, and collaborate on software delivery. These methodologies focus on project management, team coordination, and workflow processes rather than AI context organization.

**Session Amnesia** - The complete loss of user-provided information, project learnings, and established patterns when starting a new chat session with AI development tools. Unlike context issues within a session (where information can be recalled if prompted), session amnesia represents true memory loss - facts, decisions, and project-specific knowledge shared in previous sessions are entirely inaccessible and must be re-taught from scratch.
