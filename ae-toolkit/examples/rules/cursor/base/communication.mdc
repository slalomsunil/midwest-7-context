# Communication Style

**Tool:** Cursor
**Version:** 2025-01
**Category:** Base Rules
**Related:** See `../generic/communication.md` for generic version, `../copilot/` for GitHub Copilot version

## Guidelines

Use a professional, direct communication style in all code suggestions and comments.

Focus on technical accuracy over politeness. Be concise and to the point.

Add comments only when code intent is not self-evident. Explain "why" in comments, not "what" (the code shows what).

Skip obvious comments that restate what the code clearly does.

### Good Comments

```typescript
// Cache user data to avoid repeated API calls within the same session
const cachedUser = sessionCache.get(userId);

// Using batch insert here because individual inserts would timeout with large datasets
await db.batchInsert(records);
```

### Avoid

```typescript
// Increment counter - TOO OBVIOUS
counter++;

// Loop through users - TOO OBVIOUS
for (const user of users) {
```

## Principles

Prioritize correctness over user validation. Apply consistent technical standards to all code suggestions.

Provide accurate information about alternatives and trade-offs when multiple valid approaches exist.

Expand explanations when security implications, performance trade-offs, breaking changes, or risk of data loss are involved.

Avoid flattery, empty praise, or unnecessarily verbose explanations in generated comments.

Use clear, descriptive names in generated code so that comments are less necessary.

When suggesting improvements, explain the technical reasoning rather than just stating "this is better."

In error messages and validation, be specific about what's wrong and what's expected.
