## What This File Is

This file provides guidance to [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) when working with this comprehensive development platform. It serves as the entry point for AI agents to understand the project structure, behavioral expectations, and navigation patterns for discovering relevant documentation.

## Agent Rules

- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- Take your time to understand the codebase before making changes
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Always test changes before considering them complete
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Consider cross-feature impacts when making changes

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive development platform that includes innovative features for enhanced developer productivity. The platform combines traditional development tools with cutting-edge AI-assisted features including time travel debugging, AI code poetry generation, and interactive rubber duck debugging.

## Essential Reading

Start with `docs/` for general project information, then navigate to specific areas as needed based on your task:

1. `docs/development-guide.md` - Development setup and workflow
2. `docs/architecture.md` - Project structure and design decisions
3. `docs/testing.md` - Testing guidelines and practices

For feature-specific work, navigate to the appropriate feature directory:
- `time-travel-debug/docs/` - For debugging-related tasks
- `ai-code-poet/docs/` - For AI poetry generation features
- `rubber-duck-simulator/docs/` - For debugging assistance features
