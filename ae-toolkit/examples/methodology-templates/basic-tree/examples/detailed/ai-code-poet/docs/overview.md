# AI Code Poet Overview

## What is AI Code Poet?

AI Code Poet is a creative coding assistant that generates elegant, poetic code comments and documentation. It transforms mundane technical descriptions into beautiful, metaphorical explanations that make code more engaging and memorable.

## Key Features

- **Poetic Comments**: Transforms technical comments into artistic expressions
- **Metaphorical Documentation**: Uses analogies and imagery to explain complex concepts
- **Style Adaptation**: Adapts to different poetic styles (haiku, sonnet, free verse, etc.)
- **Context Awareness**: Understands code context to generate relevant metaphors
- **Educational Mode**: Explains programming concepts through creative storytelling

## Poetry Styles

### Haiku Mode
```javascript
// Data flows like streams
// Through functions, pure and serene
// State blooms, then transcends
const processData = (input) => { ... }
```

### Sonnet Mode
```javascript
// In realms of logic where algorithms dance,
// This function weaves through arrays with grace,
// Each element transformed by coded chance,
// Finding beauty in this digital space.
const transformArray = (arr) => { ... }
```

### Free Verse Mode
```javascript
// Like a gardener tending to rows of data,
// We plant seeds of logic,
// Water them with validation,
// And harvest the fruits of computation.
const validateInput = (data) => { ... }
```
