# Interaction Analyzer Workflow

This document describes the step-by-step process for analyzing AI-human interaction patterns to identify optimization opportunities and improve collaboration effectiveness.

## Overview

The Interaction Analyzer uses a three-phase approach to systematically examine and optimize AI-human collaborative patterns:

1. **Data Collection** - Catalog available interaction data and sources
2. **Interaction Analysis** - Examine communication patterns, detect known issues, and assess overall interaction quality
3. **Recommendations** - Generate specific optimization suggestions based on identified root causes

Each phase produces a concrete output document that builds toward actionable improvements based on diagnostic insights.

## Phase 1: Data Collection

### 1.1 Determine Analysis Scope
- **Objective**: Work with user to select which AI interactions to analyze
- **Agent Actions**:
  - Ask user what type of AI interactions they want to analyze
  - Explain available options: Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or both
  - Ask the user, if they haven't told you, what has made them want to analyze their interactions
  - Get user confirmation on the chosen approach

### 1.2 Execute Data Gathering
- **Objective**: Run appropriate script(s) to collect interaction data based on user choice
- **IMPORTANT**: Execute scripts using absolute paths without changing working directory
- **Agent Actions**:
  - **For Claude Code**: Run `${INTERACTION_ANALYZER_DIR}/scripts/gather-claude.sh` with appropriate options
  - **For GitHub Copilot**: Run `${INTERACTION_ANALYZER_DIR}/scripts/gather-copilot.sh` with appropriate options
  - **For Both**: Run both scripts sequentially using absolute paths
  - Monitor script execution for errors or warnings
  - Verify scripts complete successfully
  - **DO NOT** use `cd` commands or change working directory

### 1.3 Create Collection Summary
- **Objective**: Document what data is available for analysis
- **Output**: `${INTERACTION_ANALYZER_DIR}/build/DATA_COLLECTION_SUMMARY.md`
- **Template**: Use `templates/DATA_COLLECTION_SUMMARY.template.md`
- **Agent Actions**:
  - Write summary to build directory: `${INTERACTION_ANALYZER_DIR}/build/DATA_COLLECTION_SUMMARY.md`
  - Document which scripts were run successfully in this session
  - Reference the navigation files generated by the scripts
  - Establish analysis scope (what data to include, ignoring any pre-existing data)
  - Confirm data collection is complete and ready for Phase 2

**CRITICAL**: The DATA_COLLECTION_SUMMARY.md file MUST be created in the build directory, not the root of the interaction-analyzer module.

## Phase 2: Interaction Analysis

### 2.1 Systematic Pattern Detection
- **Objective**: Check interactions against known problematic patterns
- **Actions**:
  - Review curated patterns in `patterns/` directory
  - Check each interaction for detection signals listed in pattern files
  - Document which patterns were detected with specific line numbers and evidence
  - Note frequency and severity of each detected pattern
  - Identify clusters of related issues

### 2.2 Open-ended Diagnostic Analysis
- **Objective**: Identify root causes not covered by known patterns
- **Actions**:
  - **Communication Effectiveness**: Examine prompt clarity, context provision, and iteration patterns
  - **Tool Limitation Analysis**: Identify where tool constraints caused inefficiency
  - **Context Management**: Assess how well context is maintained across interactions
  - **Novel Failure Modes**: Document new patterns of inefficiency
  - **Root Cause Identification**: Focus on *why* interactions failed, not just that they did

### 2.3 Overall Interaction Quality Assessment
- **Objective**: Synthesize findings into overall quality assessment
- **Actions**:
  - Combine insights from pattern detection and open analysis
  - Assess overall interaction effectiveness with qualitative scoring
  - Identify most impactful issues affecting productivity
  - Extract key examples that demonstrate root causes
  - Document specific evidence supporting the assessment

### 2.4 Create Interaction Analysis
- **Objective**: Document diagnostic findings and root causes
- **Output**: `INTERACTION_ANALYSIS.md`
- **Template**: Use `templates/INTERACTION_ANALYSIS.template.md`

## Phase 3: Recommendations

### 3.1 Map Findings to Root Causes
- **Objective**: Review findings from Phase 2 to identify addressable root causes
- **Actions**:
  - Group identified issues by root cause category (user patterns, documentation, tool limitations)
  - Note frequency and severity of each issue type
  - Identify which root causes are addressable vs. which require workarounds
  - Connect each pattern or issue to its underlying cause

### 3.2 Generate Targeted Recommendations
- **Objective**: Create specific recommendations that directly address identified problems
- **Actions**:
  - For each root cause identified in Phase 2, develop specific improvement recommendations
  - Ensure each recommendation links back to evidence from the analysis
  - Distinguish between changes to documentation, user behavior, and tool workarounds
  - Group related recommendations together
  - Include both tactical improvements and strategic changes

### 3.3 Structure Recommendations by Category
- **Objective**: Organize recommendations into actionable categories
- **Actions**:
  - Group recommendations by type (documentation improvements, interaction patterns, tool workarounds)
  - Order recommendations within each category by dependency
  - Highlight quick wins that require minimal effort
  - Note any recommendations that depend on each other
  - Identify which recommendations address multiple issues

### 3.4 Create Improvement Recommendations
- **Objective**: Document specific, actionable optimization suggestions rooted in diagnostic findings
- **Output**: `IMPROVEMENT_RECOMMENDATIONS.md`
- **Template**: Use `templates/IMPROVEMENT_RECOMMENDATIONS.template.md`
- **Actions**:
  - Write recommendations document following the template structure
  - Ensure each recommendation references specific issues from Phase 2
  - Include concrete examples where appropriate
  - Provide clear next steps for implementation

## Success Indicators

### Analysis Complete
- All interaction data has been collected and inventoried
- Known patterns have been systematically checked
- Root causes of inefficiencies have been identified
- Overall interaction quality has been assessed with evidence
- Specific improvement recommendations have been generated based on diagnostic findings

**Remember**: This workflow helps teams understand *why* their AI interactions are inefficient, not just *that* they are. The goal is diagnostic insights that explain root causes, enabling targeted improvements.
