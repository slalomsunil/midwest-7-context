# What We're Building

List the logged in users so that the current user can send them the message, just focus on listing. Any logged out user must be removed from the list dynamically. 

## Technical Approach
1. Identify the logged in users from the database
2. list them in the UI, in a very clean interface, get inspired from either whatsapp or any other chat app
3. if a user logs out, immediately refresh the list without impacting user experience.



## Testing Plan

### Unit Tests

- write tests first before implementing actual code. use TDD test driven development
