What We're Building
create c4 architecture diagrams (c1,c2,c3 and c4) for the entire stack in the docs folder after reviewing the current architecture.md and the entire frontend and backend code. create 4 md files one for each in C4 architecture.Update the architecture diagrams in each of these using mermaid format.Link them up to the main architecture.md.

I also want to update the copilot instructions to say that anytime and story is completed, the diagrams must be reviewed and updated if any updates are necessary and get user confirmation. addiitonal information: backend is deployed to azure webapp with sqllite in memory database and react is deployed to azure static webapp, there is gpt-40-mini deployed in azure for ai layer. repo is github and pipelines are github actions.
