Story Overview
As a User I want to select a creative chat mode that transforms my message with personality and emojis. After selecting the mode i want to send the message to a selected user who is online and receive a response.

10 Creative Chat Modes (with full transformation specs):

😎 Pirate Mode - "Ahoy matey! ⚓🏴‍☠️"
🎭 Shakespeare Mode - "Verily, thy words... 📜✨"
🤖 Robot Mode - "BEEP.BOOP.PROCESSING... 🔧⚙️"
😱 Horror Mode - "Your words... whispered in shadows... 👻🕷️"
🎉 Party Mode - "YAAAS! Everything! Is! EXCITING! 🥳💃"
🧙‍♂️ Fantasy Mode - "By ancient magic... ✨🐉"
👽 Alien Mode - "Greetings earthling... 🛸👾"
🕵️ Detective Mode - "The evidence suggests... 🔍📝"
💼 Corporate Mode - "Circling back to synergize... 📊💻"
🦖 Gen Z Mode - "No cap, this is bussin fr fr! 💅✨"

For example: I select an online userA and select a Pirate Mode and send "Hi", the user would see "Ahoy matey! ⚓🏴‍☠️ and then the user responds back with the mode they choose"
