# midwest-7-context

We are building a social media POC to demonstrate how we can leverage AI to accellerate engineering.
We have two repos:
* UI: https://github.com/slalomsunil/midwest-7-ui/tree/feature/azure-integration
* Service: https://github.com/slalomsunil/midwest-7-service/tree/feature/azure-integration

We would like to build full stack features across those two repositories.  We would like the UI to understand endpoints available in Service.  Build Service endpoints if existing endpoints do not meet what is needed to complete the feature
